# Filmy

Small movie site to browser movies:

- Browse popular movies
- Browse movies by categories
- Search for movie
- Display full movie details

Try the demo at
[https://awnigharbia.github.io/filmy/#/](https://awnigharbia.github.io/filmy/#/)

## Quick Setup

Install all the application's dependencies:

`npm install` or `yarn install`

Next, you can start the application in a local environment with:

`npm start` or `yarn start`

The browser should automatically open to `http://localhost:3000/filmy/` which
will display the application running.

Otherwise, you can build application into the `<rootDir>/build` directory with:

`npm run build` or `yarn build`

After that you can serve the optimized web application build at
`http://localhost:5000/filmy/` by default locally with:

`npm run serve` or `yarn serve`
